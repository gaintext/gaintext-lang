chapter: GainText specification
===============================


Document structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Paragraphs
----------

Normal text can be written without paying attention to line breaks.
Consecutive lines are joined into one paragraph.
One or several blank lines can be used to separate paragraphs.
It is recommended to add a line break at the end of each sentence,
as that makes it easier to edit the document without having
to reformat too many lines.


Named elements
--------------

Elements add structure to the document.
They are used to describe what is being written.

example:
  `````
  section: title of the section
  `````
  This defines a new section of the document, with the given title.

The name of an element may consists of several words.
However, the name is not free but has to be defined by the used template.
The first word of the name selects if and which additional information can be used within the element name.

example:
  `````
  abbreviation CPU: Central Processing Unit.
  abbreviation OS: Operating System.
  `````

Common first words of an element name may be written on one line, with the rest indented on the following lines.

example:
  `````
  abbreviation
    CPU: Central Processing Unit.
    OS: Operating System.
  `````

Only previously defined element names (e.g. by a template) are recognized.
All other names simply represent normal text.

Elements are only recognized when they start a new block.

example:
  `````
  location: Berlin
  location: New York
  `````

  This defines two elements (given a definition for element name "location"), while the following is parsed as one text paragraph:

  `````
  We meet in the following
  location: central station, Nuremberg.
  `````

If normal text would be misinterpreted as an element, it can be escaped by enclosing it in `~`.

example:
  `````
  ~location:~Â is rendered as normal text.
  `````

As a convention, GainText element names start with a lowercase character and are therefor less likely
to conflict with the start of a text paragraph.


Attributes
----------

Elements may contain attributes:

example:
  `````
  section: title of the section #id .class attr=value
  `````

  `````
  section: title of the section {#id .class attr=value}
  `````

  `````
  section: "title of the section" #id .class attr=value
  `````

# This does not work, because it has a `#` at the beginning of the line:
# `````
# section: title of the section
#   #id .class attr=value
# `````

  this is an abbreviation for:

  `````
  section: title of the section
    id: id
    class: class
    key: value
  `````


TBD:
  Some attributes are added implicitly.
  Having an ID for every section of the document would be important, for example.
  But adding this to every element might be overkill and generating a good ID for all elements might not be easy.
  Maybe whis would simply be solved by offloading this to the element definition (implementing a genID function for sections)?

  Maybe don't explain attributes here at all and concentrate on the semantic structure.
  Element definitions could then generate attributes automatically, based on RDF properties.

  The *title* has to be handled by the element definition, too.
  Simple elments may use it as the element content, while section-like elements will put it into its own `<title>` tag.

  Move down!


Indentation
-----------

Elements can also contain content.
Everything which is indented further than the element is considered to be content of the element.

example:
  `````
  example:
    This is an example.

    This is the second paragraph of the example.
  `````

The text after the element definition usually contains some title or identifier
while the indented lines afterwards define the actual contents.

example:
  `````
  section: This is the title of the section
    This is a paragraph within the section.

    And another.
  `````

Indentation can be used to define a hierarchical structure.
The indented content of an element can contain new elements.
Those also belong to the content of the parent element.
They may be used to further describe that element or to
restrict the scope of the inner element.

example:
  `````
  requirement: #req-id
    The example shall be understandable.

    rationale:
      Otherwise it is futile.

  test: #test-id
    Ask a new user if he understands the example.

    verifies: [#req-id]
  `````
  TBD: Syntax for links?


example:
  `````
  TBD hierarchical structure
  `````

  `````
  TBD scoped elements
  `````

Indentation can also be used to introduce elements without any introduction line.
When text is indented at least four spaces or one tab, then it is considered
to be a verbatim (code) block.

example:
  `````
  Normal Text within one paragraph.

      Text which is indented at least four spaces or one tab
      will be rendered as a code block.
  `````

TBD: make type of created indent element configurable?
TBD: is default-to-code enough when we can map elements in a context-sensitive way?

A line which is indented one to three spaces starts a new paragraph.

example:
  `````
  Normal Text within one paragraph.
    Text which is indented one to three spaces against the base indent
  will start a new block (paragraph or element context).
   * list item in a new block
   * second list item in the same new block
  `````



Structure from headers
----------------------

Tree structure can also be specified by providing headers on different levels.

example:
  ``````
  element: level 1
  ================

  content on level 1

  element: level 2
  ----------------

  content on level 1
  ``````

When defining sections, the "section:" part can also be omitted.

example:
  ``````
  section: new section
  --------------------

  text paragraph.
  ``````

  is parsed the same as:

  ``````
  new section
  -----------

  text paragraph.
  ``````

Each indentation level has it's own set of header markers.

example:
  `````
  section: level1
  +++++++++++++++

  section: level2

    section: level3
    ----------------

    section: level4
    +++++++++++++++

  # Q: do we actually allow to mix both header styles within one level?
  # A: Yes we do, because we want to support other indented elements here, too.
  section: level2
  ---------------
  `````


Shortcuts
---------

Some commonly used element have shortcuts so that they can be created easier.

Lists can be introduced with the characters `*`, `+`, and `-`:

example:
  `````
  TODO:
   * first item
   * and another
     - subitem 1
     - subitem 2
   * last item
  `````
  Multiple levels can be created by indentation.
  If the list immediately follows a line of normal text,
  than it has to be indented by one to three spaces to be
  recognized.
  We recommend to consistently indent the first level by one space.


Numbered lists can be created like this:

example:
  ``````
  1. first item
  2. and another
     a) subitem 1
     b) subitem 2
  3. last item
  ``````
  Each numbered item can be introduced by an optional open brace,
  a number and an closing brace or symbol.
  E.g. `(1)`, `b.`, `iii`, `[IV]`, and `<5>` are all valid number
  schemes.


Element content can be enclosed by marker lines.

example:
  `````
  Verbatim code block:
  ```
  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      printf("Hello, world.");
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  `````

Indentation can also be used to define an implicit code section.
Any block indented with at least four spaces or one tab is taken as a "Code" element.
Additional indentation is taken verbatim as indentation within the code block.

example:
  `````
  Hello world program:
      int main(int argc, char **argv) {
          printf("Hello world.");
          return 0;
      }
  `````
  This is parsed identical to the previous example.


Lines starting with `>` form block quotes.

example:
  `````
  > Just like quoted lines in email,
  > the text after the `>` quote characters
  > is concatenated from following lines.
  >> This is a blockquote within another.
  `````



Text markup
~~~~~~~~~~~

A span of text can be attributed:

example:
  `````
  Text with [em:emphasis] or [strong:strong emphasis].
  [style color=red: [em: red emphasis]]
  `````

The markup is always enclosed in a matching pair of brackets (`[]`),
the text content comes after a colon (`:`), everything before the colon is used to attribute this text.


Links
-----

example:
  `````
  Please visit our [link http://example.com/: Homepage].
  A link to another part of the document [link #id] or to another document [link doc.gain].
  Adding a link to some text: [link doc.gain: some text].
  Link to a website (containing a colon in the URL): [link "http://www.example.com/"].
  `````


Images and figures
------------------

example:
  `````
  Inline image:
  [image a.png]
  [image a.png title="title": alternative text]
  `````

example:
  `````
  Figure: #fig1
    [image fig1.png]
    Description of the figure
    # TBD: find better syntax?
  `````

Mathematics
-----------

example:
  `````
  Inline equation ([math: E = m c^2]) using TeX syntax or block mode:

  Math:
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  `````


Shortcuts
---------

There are several abbreviations:

example:
  `````
  [[Name of section]]      instead of [link #id-of-section: Name of section]
  http://b.c.de            instead of [link "http://b.c.de"]
  a@b.c.de                 instead of [mailto:a@b.c.de]
  `pre-formatted code`     instead of [code: pre-formatted code]
  ~raw text, no markup~    instead of [raw: raw text, no markup]
  *emphasize*              instead of [em: emphasize]
  **strong empasize**      instead of [strong: strong emphasize]
  $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$        instead of [math: a^2 = b^2 + c^2]
  `````

example:
  `````
  ```
  pre-formatted code
  ```

  instead of

  Pre:
    pre-formatted code
  `````


These additional special characters are only interpreted when the
opening and closing part are on the same line and when there is
no whitespace after the opening and before the closing part.
I.e. `The costs are $5 and $10.` will not trigger math mode.

Literate brackets can be inserted by escaping them with [raw:~]:

example:
  `~[~` to get a ~[~.
  `~]~` to get a ~]~.
  `[raw:~]` to get a single [raw:~].
  `*~**foo**~*` to get emphasis on a word with raw asterisks (*~**foo**~*).



Inline HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~

An XML subtree can be embedded verbatim into the document.
It has to start on a line of its own and has to end at the end of a line.

Alternatively, `<span>` elements may be inserted directly into the text.
